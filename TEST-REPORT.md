# ZMS Live-Site Automated Test Report

**Date:** 2026-09-28T14:27:17.340Z

**Target:** https://cashappsy.github.io/ZMS/ (deployed main branch)

**Method:** fetched the *deployed* index.html + all js/css assets from GitHub Pages and executed them in a jsdom browser sandbox (the app is local-only until cloud sync is enabled, so no production data was touched).

## Verdict

| Result | Count |
|---|---|
| **Passed** | 134 |
| **Failed** | 0 |
| Overall | STABLE & FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅ |

## Performance

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| App boot (store init from live bundle) | 11 ms |
| Mean route render | ~18 ms |
| Slowest route | ~53 ms |
| Repeated renders (12x dashboard) | 0 errors |

## Coverage Highlights

- Deployment integrity: every live asset byte-identical to the committed repo.
- Boot: modules load, zero window errors, bootstrap admin granted.
- Dummy data: departments, people, projects(+subproject), tasks(+subtasks, assignees, custom fields, tags, saved filters).
- Roles: **member** (status-only on assigned tasks, everything else denied), **manager** (own projects only, create projects/tasks in own projects), **admin** (full).
- Features: all 11 routes, editors, derived progress engine, filters/sort/group, 8+ reports with real status-color donut, activity log, undo/redo, export/import (sanitized), backups, themes (light/dark) + RTL Arabic, cascade delete, persistence after reload.
