# Project Manager (PMS)

A complete, offline project-management system built with **pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript** — no frameworks, no build tools, no npm, no CDN. Open `index.html` by double-clicking it and it runs directly from the filesystem (`file://` protocol).

## Features

- **Bilingual UI (Arabic / English)** with instant language toggle (no reload), full RTL layout switching, and per-field `{ en, ar }` translations.
- **Light / dark themes** applied via `data-theme` CSS variables.
- **Data model**: Departments, People, Projects (unlimited nesting), Tasks (unlimited nesting, checklist, comments, activity log, dependencies), custom fields, statuses, priorities, saved filters.
- **Persistence**: IndexedDB (`pms-db` / `app` / `pms-data`) with automatic `localStorage` fallback; plus optional JSON **file binding** via the File System Access API (Chrome/Edge).
- **Task views**: Table (virtualized for thousands of rows, grouping, sorted columns), Kanban (drag & drop), Gantt (drag bars, dependency arrows), Calendar (month / week).
- **Reports**: a registry of built-in reports (project status, tasks by status/priority/department/person, overdue, workload, estimated-vs-actual hours, budget) rendered as tables + SVG charts, exportable to CSV.
- **Filters**: multi-criteria filter bar (search, project, person, department, statuses, priorities, tags, dates, overdue-only, custom field values) with saved filters.
- **Progress engine**: leaf tasks use their own progress; parents and projects aggregate children (optionally weighted by estimated hours).
- **Export / Import / Backups**: CSV/JSON export, JSON import (merge or replace), manual + automatic in-page backups with retention.
- **Undo / Redo** (snapshots, last 50 edits), **keyboard shortcuts**, **print CSS**, and a demo data generator.

## How to run

1. Double-click `index.html` (open in Chrome/Edge for full features).
2. Fire up demo data: **Settings → File binding → Load demo data**.
3. Persistence is automatic (IndexedDB). Data survives browser restarts.

## Architecture rules

- **Single global namespace** `window.PMS` (`PMS.*`). Every file is an IIFE that reads/writes `PMS`.
- **No ES modules** — load order in `index.html` matters. New scripts must be added in the correct position (core → data → services → ui → views → app/main).
- **All data mutations flow through repositories → `PMS.store.commit(fn, desc)`**. Views never write to storage directly.
- **Exports follow the registered services**: views/reports/field types are registered into `PMS.registry` so nothing is hard-coded in the shell.

## Adding a new view

1. Create `js/views/myview.js`:
   ```js
   (function (PMS) {
     "use strict";
     var h = PMS.dom.h;
     var t = function (k, v) { return PMS.i18n.t(k, v); };
     var view = {
       id: "myview",
       path: "/myview",          // used by the sidebar nav (nav:true only)
       titleKey: "nav.myview",   // must exist in en.js + ar.js
       icon: "★",                // optional
       nav: true,                // false => accessible by route but hidden from sidebar
       render: function (container, params) {
         container.innerHTML = "";
         container.appendChild(h("h1", { text: t("myview.title") }));
         var off = PMS.bus.on("store:changed", function () { view.render(container, params); });
         return function () { off(); };   // cleanup is called when navigating away
       }
     };
     PMS.registry.registerView(view);
     PMS.router.register("/myview", "myview");
   })(window.PMS);
   ```
2. Add `<script src="js/views/myview.js"></script>` to `index.html` *before* `js/core/app.js`.
3. Add the `nav.myview` key to both `js/i18n/en.js` and `js/i18n/ar.js`.
4. Add any page-specific CSS to `css/views.css`.

## Adding a new report

1. In `js/services/report-engine.js` (or a new file that calls `PMS.reports.register`):
   ```js
   PMS.reports.register({
     id: "myReport",
     titleKey: "reports.report_myReport",   // add to both dictionaries
     generate: function (data) {            // data = full store data object
       return {
         description: "...",
         columns: ["name", "count"],
         rows: [ { name: "x", count: 1 } ]
       };
     }
   });
   ```
2. It will automatically appear in the **Reports** view, be renderable as a chart, and exportable to CSV.

## Adding a new custom field type

1. Create a type descriptor `{ key, render(field, value) → { el, getValue() } }` and register it:
   ```js
   PMS.registry.registerFieldType({
     key: "rating",                     // matched by type: "rating"
     labelKey: "settings.fieldTypes.rating",
     render: function (field, value) {
       var input = PMS.dom.h("input.input", { type: "number", min: "1", max: "5" });
       return { el: input, getValue: function () { return input.value || null; } };
     }
   });
   ```
2. Add the label key to both dictionaries. It becomes selectable in **Settings → Custom fields**.

## Adding a new language

1. Duplicate `js/i18n/en.js` into `js/i18n/<code>.js` and translate every string.
2. In `js/core/i18n.js` ensure `<code>` is in the allowed `lang` list (and add it to the language selector in Settings + the topbar toggle logic in `js/core/app.js`).
3. Keep the English keys exactly identical — keys are the contract.

## Persistence & file binding

- IndexedDB keeps the app fully offline; data is saved automatically 300 ms after each change.
- **File binding** (Settings → File binding → Bind to file) links a JSON file on disk; every save also writes to it. The handle persists in IndexedDB and permission is re-requested on load (needs a user gesture).

## Undo / Redo

- Every `store.commit` pushes a snapshot (limit 50). Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y (or the topbar buttons) revert/apply. Restoring a backup or importing in "replace" mode resets the undo history.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Focus the global search |
| `N` | New task |
| `Shift+N` | New project |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` | Undo / Redo |

## Main extension points (cheat sheet)

| Goal | File | Hook |
|------|------|------|
| New view | `js/views/*.js` | `PMS.registry.registerView` + `PMS.router.register` |
| New report | report layer | `PMS.reports.register` |
| New field type | `js/ui/field-types.js` | `PMS.registry.registerFieldType` |
| New entity | `js/data/schema.js` + `js/data/repositories.js` | add collection to schema + repos |
| New migration | `js/data/migrations.js` | `PMS.migrations.register(from, to, fn)` |
| New translation | `js/i18n/*.js` | add keys to both dictionaries |

## Security

This app ships with client-side hardening, but the **real security boundary for shared
cloud data is the Firestore security rules** — client-side checks only protect the UI.

Implemented hardening (`js/`):

- **Admin-gated management**: `updateUser`, `resetPassword`, `removeUser`
  return `forbidden` unless the current session is the admin (or the very first
  bootstrap account is being created). The cloud-account bridge may only sync the
  role of a uid that Firebase Auth just verified. Destructive actions
  (restore, import-replace) additionally re-confirm the admin password.
- **No role input from clients at all**: `createUser` and `signUpWithPassword`
  no longer accept a role — a new account is always `member`, except the very
  first (bootstrap) account. Role changes are admin-only via `updateUser`
  (local) or the `adminSetRole` cloud function (cloud); `setCloudRole` is
  admin-gated, role-validated and routes through the trusted backend first.
- **No public session minting** (`ZMS-RT-03`): the auth bridge is internal only —
  `PMS.auth` exposes no `adopt*/register*` helpers. The bridge lives on a separate
  `PMS.cloudBridge` namespace (called only by the cloud login flow) and requires a
  `cloudUid` matching both the account record and a uid verified by a real Firebase
  Auth result — an id alone can never create a session. Test-only hooks are gated by
  a `window.__ZMS_TEST__` flag that only the local test suite sets.
- **Cloud account removal is backend-only**: deleting a shared cloud account runs
  through the `adminDeleteUser` callable; there is no direct browser fallback. The
  callable also deletes/disables the Firebase Authentication identity (`ZMS-RT-02`).
- **Credentials stay local**: password hashes/salts are stripped from JSON exports,
  JSON imports and backup snapshots (existing accounts keep their password; new
  imported accounts need a password reset).
- **Session lifetime**: local sessions expire after 7 days regardless of browser state.
- **CSP**: a Content-Security-Policy meta tag restricts script/frame/object origins.
- **Local-only passwords** (`ZMS-RT-07/-10`): cloud passwords live in Firebase
  Authentication (strong). The offline mode uses a salted SHA-256 hash — a convenience,
  not a strong KDF; salts come from `crypto.getRandomValues` when available.

### Firestore rules — required before shared use

`firestore.rules` (repo root) removes anonymous public access and adds the
role/membership boundary that the browser cannot override:

- **Team-membership gate**: the `zms_*` shared datasets are readable only by
  *active* users whose uid exists in `zms_auth_users` (accounts created through the
  app). A random Firebase account that never joined ZMS gets nothing. Deleting or
  deactivating the account record therefore **revokes access immediately**
  (`ZMS-RT-02`, even without the cloud functions).
- **Role-gated writes** (`ZMS-RT-01/-06`): shared datasets and `zms_meta` can be
  created/updated only by an active manager/admin (members are read-only on shared
  data), and dataset documents can only be deleted by an admin. The client mirrors
  this with `canWriteShared()` so member devices do not attempt whole-dataset writes.
- **Profile privacy** (`ZMS-RT-04`): a user may read their *own* cloud profile; only
  an admin may read the directory.
- **Bootstrap admin**: the very first cloud account (while `zms_auth/bootstrap` does
  not exist yet) is minted `admin`; every later signup is forced to `member` — no
  client input can choose an elevated role. `zms_auth/bootstrap.firstUid` also keeps
  write access for pre-role deployments (migration guard, never account management).
- `zms_meta` sync metadata is read-only for normal users; only managers/admins write it
  (`ZMS-RT-08`).

Deploy in the Firebase console (Firestore → Rules → Publish) or with:

```
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Trusted backend (Cloud Functions) — OPTIONAL (paid plan)

Role changes and cloud-account deletion never trust the browser. The client
(`js/services/sync-firestore.js`) calls two HTTPS callables **when they are
deployed**:

- `adminSetRole({ uid, role })` — verifies the caller is an admin (reads
  `zms_auth_users/{callerUid}`), validates the target + role, preserves the
  last active admin, then writes the role.
- `adminDeleteUser({ uid })` — same admin check, then deletes the account
  document **and revokes the Firebase Authentication identity** so the person
  cannot authenticate again (`ZMS-RT-02`).

**Without the functions (free tier — the default here):**

- Role changes **still work**: the client falls back to an admin-gated Firestore
  write, blocked for non-admins by the Firestore rules. The client remembers the
  functions are unavailable, so there is no per-click delay.
- Cloud-account deletion is **refused from the browser**. The free alternative:
  Firebase console → Firestore → `zms_auth_users/<uid>` → delete the document.
  Because shared data access requires a profile record, deleting it revokes data
  access immediately. To also revoke Firebase Authentication (so login itself is
  refused), delete/disable the account under Authentication → Users, or deploy
  the functions.

Deploying the functions requires a **Blaze plan** (Cloud Functions are paid):

```
cd functions && npm install && cd ..
firebase deploy --only functions,firestore:rules
```

Notes:

- The current data model keeps each collection in one document, so per-project/
  per-task authorization is not expressible in rules (`ZMS-RT-05/-06`). The rules
  therefore enforce the strongest boundary the model allows: only active team
  members may read, only managers/admins may write, and members are read-only on
  shared data. True per-project/per-task isolation needs the per-record data-model
  redesign (organizations → projects → tasks documents) before this app should host
  unrelated tenants.
- Web Firebase config keys are public: they are not a secret. Restrict real access
  with the rules above + Firebase App Check for production use.
- Router/UI permission checks are UI affordances, not security controls
  (`ZMS-RT-09`); the rules above are the authorization boundary.

### Deployment-time hardening (`ZMS-RT-11/12/13`)

- **CSP / headers**: the app ships a `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag
  (`default-src 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `object-src 'none'`, plus the
  Firebase/Analytics hosts used by the SDK; `'unsafe-inline'`/`'unsafe-eval'` are
  required for the SDK and the no-build setup). GitHub Pages does not emit
  `X-Content-Type-Options`/`Referrer-Policy`/`Permissions-Policy` headers — verify
  them on whatever host you deploy to (a `.well-known/security.txt` + proper
  headers are recommended for production).
- **XSS**: all user-controlled values are rendered through `textContent` (via the
  `text:` prop or `dom.h`); every `innerHTML` sink uses `escapeHtml`/an allow-list.
  If imported data is ever rendered as HTML, keep it escaped (see `js/ui/dom.js`).
- **Environments** (`ZMS-RT-13`): keep dev and production Firebase projects
  separate; `js/cloud-config.js` is the single per-environment config point.
